## Case Study 1 [House Prices]: 
##### working with Pandas DataFrames and train a linear regression model to predict house prices.
Topics: Linear Regression, Assessing Performance (Bias + Variance Tradeoff)

## Case Study 2 [Ridge and Lasso]: 
##### train models that use different regularizers and different penalties and to analyze how this affects the model.
Topics: Regularization: Ridge, Lasso Feature Selection

## Case Study 3 [Predicting Sentiment from Amazon Product Review]:
##### working with Pandas Dataframes to do feature engineering, train a logistic regression model to predict the sentiment of product reviews, inspect the weights (coefficients) of a trained logistic regression model, make a prediction (both class and probability) of sentiment for a new product review, creating a confusion matrix, and compare multiple logistic regression models.
Topic: Classification, MLE/ Logistic Regression

## Case Study 4 [Loan Safety with Logistic Regression]
Topic: Decision Trees, Ensemble Trees

## Case Study 5 [Kaggle Competition: Predict Income with Census Data]
Topics: Precision + Recall / kNN, Kernel Methods, Locality Sensitive Hashing
